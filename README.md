YORO
====
You Only Remember Once

We have noticed in the past that many reminder apps do not integrate well with external data sources. However, with the availability of several location-based APIs and the addition of a geolocation feature in Yo, we saw an opportunity to combine the ease of use of Yo with increased relevancy of a "reminders" application to help connect users geographically to their tasks list.

Consider the following scenario: Joe needs to pick up a basket of eggs for the birthday party tomorrow to make a cake. He enters YoRo via mobile or desktop browser, and writes a quick and easy free-hand note: "remind me to pick up eggs at 2PM tomorrow". Immediately, a request is stored online that matches his request against a list of known products. At 2PM, a Yo is sent to him from "YoReminders", and as he responds to the Yo, YoRo tracks his location to find the nearest store (using the Yelp API) that matches his need to "pick up eggs", in this case a grocery store. A second Yo is sent with an easy to access link, and when the Yelp page opens up, Joe can see not only what he needs to do, but also where he needs to go and how long it will take to complete his task.

YoRo makes it easy for a user to not only remember a task, but identify exactly how the task can be completed in minimal time.

However, there's still a lot of room for growth to make the product more customizable.

1. Learn over time the price range of preference for the user, or learn directly via a survey.
2. Fine-tune the classification of different subjects into more detail for better recommendation of stores (i.e. we don't want to recommend the apple store to an android user).
